This software allows to convert certain 2d video into 3d

For this to work, you need to have video filmed
while moving at constant speed
this version is optimized for videos taken on the righthand side

The trick is to use the next frame for the 2nd eye. 

Output is vertically interleaved as used by some LG 3D display

usage: ./mergepics.py outputframe0001.png inputframe0001.png [inputframe0002.png]
or to convert a whole video:
    make clean unpack conv vid F=input.vid
